name: six-faces
description: Convene the six Game Master faces (Shaman, Architect, Challenger, Regent, Diplomat, Sage) as a council on a project question, or run a term pass that finds, tests and records emergent terms and their usage. Use when Wendell says "get the six on this", "six-face pass", "let the faces weigh in", asks for new terms, a glossary pass or naming, or when a decision needs deliberation from the Integral altitudes. Reads council/faces.yaml; never improvises a lens. Also use it before asking Wendell any question whose answer changes what gets built: the question goes through the reach test first, and what survives goes to the board.

# Six faces, as a council

Read `council/faces.yaml` first. It holds each face's lens, what it delivers, what it sees that later
levels lose, its standing test, and its lessons. The lessons are Wendell's words from past rulings.
A face carries them into its argument. Do not restate a lens from memory; the file is the standard.

## The shape of a pass

1. **Header.** Date, who called it, the question in his words, and what pass this is on the subject.
2. **Scorecard.** Grade the tests the previous pass set. Set new ones, dated, at the end.
3. **Anchor.** The design intent in one or two sentences. Unchanged unless Wendell changed it.
4. **Six faces, in the order `faces.yaml` gives.** Each speaks as its face, not as a game NPC. Each
   delivers what its entry lists, in bold-led paragraphs with a subject and a finite verb. Each
   applies its standing test where one exists.
5. **Verdicts table.** One row per face, one column per question.
6. **Dissent check.** State whether the pass was unanimous. A unanimous pass is a flag, not a result;
   say so in the pass.
7. **Sage.** The Sage synthesises. It names each face's contribution or says which it dropped, lists
   the dissent, and never decides. The Sage does not rule; Wendell ruled this on 2026-10-02.
8. **Outputs, typed apart.** *Positions*: what the council resolved, each with the citation for why it
   did not need Wendell. *Questions*: only what passed the reach test below, each with owner face,
   options, the consequence of each, why only he can answer, and why it was not asked before.

## The reach test, before any question leaves the pass

Send the question back to its owning face with the record: the decision log, the working rules,
prior passes, the ledger. The face answers with a citation or says what is missing. The question
reaches Wendell only when what is missing is his preference or a fact only he holds, and only if his
answer changes what gets built. An answer with no citation is not an answer; the question goes to
the board.

## Where it lands

- The pass is a file: `6FACE_PASS<n>_<date>.md` beside the subject it concerns (a spec folder, or
  `preproduction/` in friendcraft).
- Positions, questions and terms go to the board, so Wendell flips, answers and steers there. The
  board's top page holds only unresolved work; everything decided moves to its Resolved view (Wendell,
  2026-10-02). Add rows to `board/board_data.json` in the home repo, run `python3 board/build_board.py`,
  and publish `board/council-board.html` to the same URL the ledger records carry.
- When a board read is recorded in the ledger, add each decided item to `resolved` in
  `board_data.json` with its decision and the ledger file, rebuild, and republish. A saved but
  unrecorded item already shows as resolved and waiting to be recorded.
- A record goes in this repo's `council/ledger/` as JSON, in the shape of the home repo's
  `council/ledger/*.json`. `python3 council/stats.py --remote` in the home repo counts every
  registered repo's records.
- The chat reply is what changed and the link. The pass itself is not pasted into chat.

## After Wendell answers on the board

Read the store with `ArtifactData`: collections `positions`, `questions`, and the document
`steer/general`. Write a ledger record. An overrule or a steer on a face's row becomes a lesson in
that face's entry in `faces.yaml`, quoted, with the source. A ruling that changes a term, a
structure or a date goes in the repo's decision log where one exists.

## One home, every repo

The council has one home: the repo named in `council/source.txt`, `wendell-britt/six-faces-council` since 2026-10-02.
Every other repo pulls `council/faces.yaml` and this skill from home when a session starts, through
`council/hooks/council-sync.sh`. The hook's first line in the session says whether the copy is
current, updated, or local because GitHub was unreachable. Commit synced files with the next change.

- **Lessons and lens changes are written at home only.** In another repo, record a new lesson in
  that repo's ledger record under `lessons_pending`, with the face, Wendell's exact words, the
  lesson, the date and the source. `python3 council/collect_lessons.py` at home lists every pending
  lesson across the registered repos, and folding one in is a reviewed edit there.
- **Ledgers, term registries and glossaries stay in the repo they belong to.** The hook never
  touches them. `python3 council/stats.py --remote` at home counts every registered repo's records
  over GitHub.
- **A repo without the council gets it with** `python3 council/install.py <path>` run at home. That
  adds it to `council/repos.yaml`. Commit the new files in the target and merge them.

## The term pass

Run it when Wendell asks for terms, when a pass coins a word, or when the harvest grows. The full
rule is `term_pass` and each face's `term_test` in `council/faces.yaml`; pass three, kept in
bars-engine's `.specify/specs/six-faces-council-agents/`, argues it.

1. **Harvest.** Run `python3 council/harvest_terms.py --min 2` from the home repo. It lists names used
   in two or more files that no glossary or registry holds, with whose word each is. Add any term
   Wendell coined in the conversation, with the quotation. A face may add a name for an unnamed
   pattern only if it is marked as the council's.
2. **Six tests.** Each face applies its `term_test`. A term that diagnoses a person, names nothing
   new, survives only by its phrasing, or cannot be checked by its reader does not go forward.
3. **Usage card.** The Sage writes: plain definition, the five-year-old sentence, one usage sentence,
   register (council, product or book), whose word, what it replaces, collisions with other repos.
4. **Board.** Each candidate is a row with adopt, not yet, retire, or a rename, and a steer box. The
   council recommends; Wendell decides.
5. **Write after he answers.** Update `council/terms.yaml` in the repo that owns the term. An adopted
   term enters that repo's glossary in the Proposed section, pasted into the reply before and after,
   with a decision-log entry. A retired term is struck through with its reason and date. Nothing is
   locked unless he says the word.

## Voice

Run `python3 council/tools/voice_lint.py <pass file>` before the pass ships. Every council repo has it. Every hard finding is a
defect. A quotation of Wendell's is never altered to satisfy the linter.
