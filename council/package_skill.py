"""Build the portable six-faces skill for upload to a claude.ai account.

Usage: python3 council/package_skill.py [out.zip]
Bundles council/portable/six-faces/SKILL.md with the current council/faces.yaml and a snapshot date,
as a zip whose top folder is six-faces/. Upload it at claude.ai Settings > Customize > Skills. An
uploaded skill reaches claude.ai chats, the desktop and mobile apps, and Claude Code cloud sessions.
Re-run and re-upload after faces.yaml gains a lesson; the uploaded copy does not update itself.
