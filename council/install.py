"""Install the six-faces council into a repo, new or existing.

Usage: python3 council/install.py <target_repo_path> [--source owner/repo@ref] [--no-register]

Run from the home repo (named in council/source.txt). It writes into the target:
  council/source.txt              the home repo the target pulls shared files from
  council/faces.yaml              the shared definition file (kept current by the hook)
  .claude/skills/six-faces/       the skill (kept current by the hook)
  council/tools/voice_lint.py     the house voice lint, so any repo can lint a pass (kept current)
  council/hooks/council-sync.sh   the session-start hook that pulls updates from home
  .claude/settings.json           the hook registered under SessionStart, merged with what is there
  council/terms.yaml              an empty term registry, if the repo has none
  council/ledger/                 where this repo's pass records go
It then adds the target's GitHub remote to council/repos.yaml here, unless --no-register.
Nothing is committed. The target's own files (glossaries, decision logs, ledgers) are never changed.
