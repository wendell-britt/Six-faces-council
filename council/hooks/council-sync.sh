# Six-faces council: pull the shared files from the home repo at session start.
#
# The home repo is named in council/source.txt as owner/repo@ref. The hook also updates itself, so a
# change to the list of shared files reaches every repo at its next session start. Every repo with the council runs
# this hook, so an update made at home (a new lesson, a changed lens, a skill rule) reaches every
# other repo the next time a session opens there. Only the shared files are pulled. Ledgers, term
# registries and glossaries belong to the repo they are in and are never touched.
#
# Fail-soft: with no network, the local copy stays and the session is told its date.
# Test override: COUNCIL_SOURCE_BASE=file:///path/to/home replaces the GitHub address.
