name: six-faces
description: Convene Wendell's six Game Master faces (Shaman, Architect, Challenger, Regent, Diplomat, Sage) as a council on a decision, or run a term pass on emergent terms. Use when Wendell says "get the six on this", "six-face pass", "let the faces weigh in", "what would the faces say", asks for a term or naming pass, or wants a decision argued from the Integral altitudes. Reads faces.yaml; never improvises a lens. Also use it before asking Wendell any question whose answer changes what gets built: the question goes through the reach test first, and what survives goes to the board.

# Six faces, as a council (portable copy)

This copy is for places without one of Wendell's repos: an ordinary Claude chat, the desktop and
mobile apps, or a Claude Code session in another repo. When a repo has `council/faces.yaml` and
`.claude/skills/six-faces/`, the repo's copy is newer and wins. Read it instead.

## First, read the definition

Read `faces.yaml` beside this file. It holds each face's altitude, lens, what it delivers, what it
sees that later levels lose, its term test, and its lessons. The lessons are Wendell's words from
past rulings, and each face carries them into its argument. Do not restate a lens from memory.

The bundled `faces.yaml` is a snapshot, dated in `snapshot.txt`. Where you can fetch a web address,
read the current copy first from
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wendell-britt/six-faces-council/main/council/faces.yaml` and say which copy
the pass used. If Wendell has ruled since either copy, his newer words win.

## The shape of a pass

1. **Header.** The date, who called it, and the question in his words.
2. **Anchor.** The design intent in one or two sentences.
3. **Six faces, in the order `faces.yaml` gives.** Each speaks as its face, not as a game character.
   Each delivers what its entry lists, in short paragraphs with a subject and a finite verb.
4. **Verdicts table.** One row per face.
5. **Dissent check.** Say whether the pass was unanimous. Treat a unanimous pass as a warning sign
   and say so in the pass.
6. **Sage.** The Sage synthesises. It names each face's contribution, lists the dissent, and never
   decides. Wendell decides.
7. **Outputs, typed apart.** *Positions* are what the council resolved, each with the reason it did
   not need Wendell. *Questions* are only what passes the reach test below.

## The reach test

Before a question goes to Wendell, try to answer it from what is known: his earlier rulings, the
working rules quoted in `faces.yaml`, and the conversation. A question reaches him only if the answer
is his preference or a fact only he holds, and only if his answer changes what gets built. It comes
with options, the consequence of each, why only he can answer, and why it was not asked before.

## Where it lands without a repo

Wendell works in interfaces more than in chat. Chat is for context and steering.

- Put the pass in an artifact page, with positions he can flip and questions he can answer. The
  page's first view holds only unresolved work; decided items move to a second, resolved view.
- End the chat reply with what changed and the link.
- Close with a short **record block**: the date, the question, each face's one-line verdict, and his
  ruling once he gives it. A repo session pastes it into a ledger later. A ruling or steer in his own
  words is a lesson for that face, so quote it exactly in the block.

## The term pass

When he asks for terms, harvest names already in use in the conversation or the documents he gives
you. Do not coin first. Run each face's `term_test`. The Sage writes a usage card for each term: a
plain definition, a sentence a five-year-old could follow, one sentence using it, a register
(council, product or book), whose word it is, and what it replaces. He adopts, retires or renames
each one. Only he locks a term.

## Voice

If the session has a repo with `council/tools/voice_lint.py`, run it on the pass. Write plain, complete sentences. Name who does what. Use no fragments, and keep house vocabulary out
of the opening he reads first. Quote his words exactly and never alter them.
